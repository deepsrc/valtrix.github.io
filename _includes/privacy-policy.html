            <br/><br/>
            Use of the Website is subject to the terms of our Terms of Use found <a href="/terms-of-use/">here</a> which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Privacy Policy. Please carefully review our Terms of Use. By using the Website, you agree to be bound by the terms of our Terms of Use.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Types and Uses of Collected Information</b>
            <br/><br/>
            Valtrix Systems collects two types of information about you on this website:
            <br/><br/>
            a.	Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities on this Website, including but not limited to registering for Valtrix Newsletters, sending feedback/message (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code) and email address. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity. Depending on the Identification Activity, Valtrix Systems may not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us.
            <br/><br/>
            If you choose to refer someone to the Valtrix Newsletters, we will ask you for your referral’s contact information, such as his or her name and email address. We may then send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Website and/or join the Valtrix Newsletters subscription. Valtrix Systems stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and maintaining the Newsletter subscription. Your friend may contact us at contact@valtrix.in request that we remove his or her contact information from our records.
            <br/><br/>
            We may use Personally Identifiable Information to send Valtrix Newsletters and provide information on products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve the Website, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy. If you use our Website to send information to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
            <br/><br/>
            b.	Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy.
            <br/><br/>
            We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Release of Personally Identifiable Information</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We will not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:
            <br/><br/>
            a.	Authorized Third Party Service Providers. Valtrix Systems may provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our or your behalf. You or We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, move data in or out of our system, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We encourage Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
            <br/><br/>
            b.	Remarketing. Remarketing is a way for Valtrix Systems to connect with people, based upon your past interactions with the Website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Valtrix Systems to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show Valtrix Systems ads on sites on the Internet. Third-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to the Website. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
            <br/><br/>
            c.	Acquisition. As with any other company, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
            <br/><br/>
            d.	As required by law. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, employers, or others.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers, and Third Party Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “Third Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies.”
            <br/><br/>
            We may use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this Website, and visits to other websites or locations in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
            <br/><br/>
            We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our Website, in order to constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Third Party Advertisers. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by Valtrix Systems.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Updating Information</b>
            <br/><br/>
            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes, as out-of-date Personally Identifiable Information may negatively affect the quality of your use and experience. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website. Additionally, it may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we may periodically backup information.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Choices on Collection/Use of Information</b>
            <br/><br/>
            You can always choose not to provide certain information, although a certain level of information is required to engage in activities on the Website.
            <br/><br/>
            You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to your activity on the Website, and include but are not limited to emails regarding your account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at [contact@valtrix.in], or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails.
            <br/><br/>

            <br/><br/>
            However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.

            <br/><br/>
            b.	Other Tracking Devices.

Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or marketing partners for the same purposes.
